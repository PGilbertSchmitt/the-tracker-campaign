Use the Mounted Soldier statblock from [Monster Shuffler](www.monstershuffler.com). There are two currently engaged in the cart, and they will prioritize the PC combatants. The NPCs in the cart will not attack. The soldiers will attempt to lasso the group, occasionally peppering them with blowgun darts. All Mounted Soldier attacks are non-lethal. Aside from the obvious win/loss conditions, if at any point the entire party is Lassoed, they will be pulled off the carts and the battle will end in a Loss.

On a WIN, go to [the crash](./2_the_crash.md)

On a LOSS, go to [the trackerman](./2_the_trackerman.md)t
