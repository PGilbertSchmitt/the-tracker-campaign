> You've managed to beat back the Grossem soldiers, but the other carts have not been fairing very well. The brother has not stopped repeating the lyric, and some of the other soldiers have noticed that your cart isn't under seige. Just as they begin to converge on you, you hear __"HOLD ON!"__ from the cart driver, who veres right into a small opening in the trees, possibly a foot path along the cliff that overlooks the river. There isn't much room between the trees on the left and the sudden sharp cliff on the right, so the soldiers have had to back off slightly. It looks like you're hitting a faster pace than the soldiers, but the cart gets a little to close to a tree on the left and the wheels bump against the thick roots.

Everyone make a DEX save (DC 15)
Everyone who fails must roll a flat D20, and the lowest roll is knocked from the cart onto the path.

> The collision was bad enough that the cart is knicked to the right. You immediately feel that sinking feeling as the wheel fails to make purchase. Soon, you and the cart are tumbling over the cliff, and you crash into the river.
