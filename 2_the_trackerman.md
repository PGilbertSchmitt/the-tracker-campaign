> You awake near the shore of the river. All around you, there are Grossem soldiers. The four of you are together, but bound at the hands and feet. You still appear to have all of your weapons (and the magic item's that you receieved at the start), but your bags have been taken from you. Nearby, you see other groups of captured refugees too, some of whom are still being moved around by the soldiers. The most notable looking person you see is a broad human man, who's resting one fine, leather boot against a stump. He's wearing leather chaps, a rugged coat with the Grossem Coat of Arms, and a wide brimmed stetson. His jaw is firm and square, his eyes are cold steel, and he has a scar stretching over the bridge of his crooked nose. He is currently staring your party down, waiting and unmoving. Eventually, the soldiers have rounded up and organized the last of the refugees and inform the man, who drops his foot and stands tall before you.

> __"Well I think it's time I about introduced myself. My name is Gunther Grossem, prince of your new Kingdom. And in Grossem, insolence is a grave offense. But don't worry, I ain't gonna try you hear and now. That wouldn't be fair, I reckon. Y'all never got the chance to hear me out. So I'm gonna give you all that opportunity right now. You can either come with us back to Grossem to lay your fealty to my pa, or you can leave, right on out to Watchford like you were plannin' before. Just didn't want you makin' it out there without giving us a shot. After all, this your home, ain't it? Might just be worth it to stay, S'all I'm sayin'."__

If performing an insight check on Gunther:
- 12 will affirm that he's not being entirely truthful
- 17 will affirm that "lay your fealty" was likely truthful, but "you can leave" was not
