Your current home of Claephis is under attack. The neighboring Kingdom of Grossem to the north west had enviously eyed your newly discovered silver mines, and the new tarifs created the push their King needed to finally invade. It started as a surprise, with several border towns on the westen boarder having been completely taken over within the first day. One of these towns, Poppywell, is only a few miles west of Lumbridge, the town in which you are currently in. Lumbridge, the largest town on River Lurr, is a quaint hamlet on the east side of a large hill. It's famous for it's sunflower farms, old windmills, and spiced beef puddings.

As news of this attack came quickly, several caravans have begun ferrying people away from the encroaching front. You were all lucky to make it onto one of these, despite the owner of the cart you're in charging an exorbitant fee. (If you have any gold on you, reduce it to 25). This caravan is heading south to Watchford, the fortified town downstream of River Lurr.

As the sun is rising, it lights up the Lumbridge Hill, and the sillhouette atop it gives a haunting clue as what it to follow. The Grossem forces have arrived, and your caravan has only just entered the first sunflower farm that forms its border. Murmurs become excited chatter become screams as the army rapidly decends into the city. The caravans pick up their pace, the bumpy dirt road creating chaos in the back of the open cart. Within minutes, you start to see columns of smoke rising from Lumbridge, a precursor to the destruction that is about to begin. However, the river heads into a small forest, and the path follows it. The trees quickly block your view of the town, and it appears the caravan has calmed a bit.

There are three other passengers besides yourselves:
- An old bald man dressed in fine silks
- A young woman in a sundress
- A young bespectacled man who appears dressed as a scholar or a librarian. He's holding his head in his hands and rocking back and forth, mumbling something rhythmic.

If anyone does a perception check on the young man:
- DC 12 - He's singing something, but you can't make out the words
- DC 16 - He's repeating the first line to an old hunting song:
    _"Sharpen your swords and string your bows, the beasts have gone away..."_

> With all the excitement dying down, one of the other refugees decides to make conversation to calm everyones nerves: __"So, leaving Lumbridge too, huh? What brought you all here in the first place? I know it's probably difficult to talk about a home that you have to leave, but if Lumbridge survives, it will be in our memories and our stories."__ Another passenger speaks: __"Oh, my brother invited me to stay a while since my home in Poppywell was being renovated. I guess that's not happenin' anymore."__

- Let everyone tell their story if they choose.

> The original man turns to the last passenger in the cart and begins to speak, but the woman quickly says __"Oh no, please don't, this is my brother. He's a very nervous person, and this sudden invasion was very hard on him"__. The original man says __"Nonesense! I'm sure if we all speak about what's on our minds, we can take it easy and stop worrying so much. So, stranger? What brought you to Lumbridge?"__. The passenger, who at this point had been . He looks up with a fright. His eyes look glassy and stare off into the distance. The cart is silent for a few seconds, then he stands straight up, almost at attention, and nervously begins to shout: _"SHARPEN YOUR SWORDS AND STRING YOUR BOWS, THE BEASTS HAVE GONE AWAY!"_ His sister attempts to calm him down, but the excitement immediately doubles.

> Many men on horseback have burst through the bush, nearly colliding with the caravan. They are wearing the Grossem standard on their tabards. They start to lasso the carriage drivers and horses, trying to slow them down. By now, the caravan has burst into screaming. There are two men currently attempting to take out your cart. Please role initiative:
